* Features/issues marked with plus (+) are implemented/solved.
* Features/issues marked with minus (-) are yet to be implemented.

Must haves
------------------------------------
- Add command line tools.
- Improve helper scripts for better documentation update.


Should haves
------------------------------------
- Optionally, maintain a local database of fastest services. Make it possible to
  analyse fastest ones and mark them then as preferred.
